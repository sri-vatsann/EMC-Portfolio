text.txt 

This is a test file to setup Git in my desktop as well as check the working of it 
I will be pushing this github text file into the local emc folder 
steps: 
1. Open terminal in VScode code : git clone 
2. Open the git hub and select code and you come up with a url which is called "ORGIN'
